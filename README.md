# BornInFire
1st Game Jam game for the Global Game Jam

This game was made in 48 hours during the Global Game Jam of 2016 by a group of 6 people (all first Year Games Tech)
The theme for this Jam was RITUAL and we explored the idea of a light orb that is trying to assemble a ritual to enlighten himself... 
More info about the project and contributors can be found on http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/born-fire

Made with Unity ;)
